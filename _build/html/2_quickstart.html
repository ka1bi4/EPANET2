<h1>2. QUICK START TUTORIAL<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-start-tutorial" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p><em>This chapter provides a tutorial on how to use EPANET. If you are
not familiar with the components that comprise a water distribution
system and how these are represented in pipe network models you might
want to review the first two sections of Chapter 3 first.</em></p>

<div class="section" id="installing-epanet">
<h2>Installing EPANET<a class="headerlink" href="#installing-epanet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>EPANET Version 2 is designed to run under the Windows 95/98/NT
operating system of an IBM/Intel-compatible personal computer. It is
distributed as a single file, <strong>en2setup.exe</strong>, which contains a
self-extracting setup program. To install EPANET:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select <strong>Run</strong> from the Windows Start menu.</li>
<li>Enter the full path and name of the <strong>en2setup.exe</strong> file or click
the <strong>Browse</strong> button to locate it on your computer.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>OK</strong> button type to begin the setup process.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The setup program will ask you to choose a folder (directory) where
the EPANET files will be placed. The default folder is <strong>c:Program
FilesEPANET2</strong>. After the files are installed your Start Menu will
have a new item named EPANET 2.0. To launch EPANET simply select this
item off of the Start Menu, then select EPANET 2.0 from the submenu that
appears. (The name of the executable file that runs EPANET under
Windows is <strong>epanet2w.exe</strong>.)</p>
<p>Should you wish to remove EPANET from your computer, you can use the
following procedure:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> from the Windows Start menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the Settings menu.</li>
<li>Double-click on the <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> item.</li>
<li>Select EPANET 2.0 from the list of programs that appears.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Add/Remove</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example Network<a class="headerlink" href="#example-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In this tutorial we will analyze the simple distribution network
shown in Figure 2.1 below. It consists of a source reservoir (e.g., a
treatment plant clearwell) from which water is pumped into a two-loop
pipe network. There is also a pipe leading to a storage tank that
floats on the system. The ID labels for the various components are
shown in the figure. The nodes in the network have the
characteristics shown in Table 2.1. Pipe properties are listed in
Table 2.2. In addition, the pump (Link 9) can
deliver 150 ft of head at a flow of 600 gpm, and the tank (Node 8)
has a 60-ft diameter, a 3.5-ft water level, and a maximum level of 20
feet.</p>

<div class="section" id="project-setup">
<h2>Project Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#project-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Our first task is to create a new project in EPANET and make sure
that certain default options are selected. To begin, launch EPANET,
or if it is already running select <strong>File &gt;&gt; New</strong> (from the menu
bar) to create a new project. Then select <strong>Project</strong>
<strong>&gt;&gt; Defaults</strong> to open the dialog form shown in Figure 2.2. We will
use this dialog to have EPANET automatically label new objects with
consecutive numbers starting from 1 as they are added to the network.
On the ID Labels page of the dialog, clear all of the ID Prefix
fields and set the ID Increment to 1. Then select the Hydraulics page
of the dialog and set the choice of Flow Units to GPM (gallons per
minute). This implies that US Customary units will be used for all
other quantities as well (length in feet, pipe diameter in inches,
pressure in psi, etc.). Also select Hazen    - Williams (H-W) as the
headloss formula. If you wanted to save these choices for all future
new projects you could check the <strong>Save</strong> box at the bottom of the
form before accepting it by clicking the <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><img alt="image1" src="_images/image2.png" /></div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Figure 2.2</strong> Project Defaults Dialog</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Next we will select some map display options so that as we add
objects to the map, we will see their ID labels and symbols
displayed. Select <strong>View &gt;&gt; Options</strong> to bring up the Map Options
dialog form. Select the Notation page on this form and check the
settings shown in Figure 2.3 below. Then switch to the Symbols page
and check all of the boxes. Click the <strong>OK</strong> button to accept these
choices and close the dialog.</p>
<p>Finally, before drawing our network we should insure that our map
scale settings are acceptable. Select <strong>View &gt;&gt; Dimensions</strong> to bring
up the Map Dimensions dialog. Note the default dimensions assigned
for a new project. These settings will suffice for this example, so
click the <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>

<div class="section" id="drawing-the-network">
<h2>Drawing the Network<a class="headerlink" href="#drawing-the-network" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We are now ready to begin drawing our network by making use of our
mouse and the buttons contained on the Map Toolbar shown below. (If
the toolbar is not visible then select <strong>View &gt;&gt; Toolbars &gt;&gt; Map</strong>).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="image3" src="_images/image4.png" /></div></blockquote>
<p>First we will add the reservoir. Click the Reservoir button <img alt="image4" src="_images/image5.png" />.
Then click the mouse on the map at the location of the reservoir
(somewhere to the left of the map).</p>
<p>Next we will add the junction nodes. Click the Junction button
<img alt="image5" src="_images/image6.png" /> and then click on the map at the locations of nodes 2
through 7.</p>
<p>Finally add the tank by clicking the Tank button <img alt="image6" src="_images/image7.png" /> and
clicking the map where the tank is located. At this point the Network
Map should look something like the drawing in Figure 2.4.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="image7" src="_images/image8.png" /></div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Figure 2.4</strong> Network Map after Adding Nodes</p>
<p>Next we will add the pipes. Let’s begin with pipe 1 connecting node 2
to node 3. First click the Pipe button <img alt="image8" src="_images/image9.png" /> on the Toolbar. Then
click the mouse on node 2 on the map and then on node 3. Note how an
outline of the pipe is drawn as you move the mouse from node 2 to 3.
Repeat this procedure for pipes 2 through 7.</p>
<p>Pipe 8 is curved. To draw it, click the mouse first on Node 5. Then
as you move the mouse towards Node 6, click at those points where a
change of direction is needed to maintain the desired shape. Complete
the process by clicking on Node 6.</p>
<p>Finally we will add the pump. Click the Pump button <img alt="image9" src="_images/image10.png" />, click
on node 1 and then on node 2.</p>
<p>Next we will label the reservoir, pump and tank. Select the Text
button <img alt="image10" src="_images/image11.png" /> on the Map Toolbar and click somewhere close to the
reservoir (Node 1). An edit box will appear. Type in the word SOURCE
and then hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key. Click next to the pump and enter its
label, then do the same for the tank. Then click the Selection button
<img alt="image11" src="_images/image12.png" /> on the Toolbar to put the map into Object Selection mode
rather than Text Insertion mode.</p>
<p>At this point we have completed drawing the example network. Your
Network Map should look like the map in Figure 2.1. If the nodes are
out of position you can move them around by clicking the node to
select it, and then dragging it with the left mouse button held down
to its new position. Note how pipes connected to the node are moved
along with the node. The labels can be repositioned in similar
fashion. To re    - shape the curved Pipe 8:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>First click on Pipe 8 to select it and then click the <img alt="image12" src="_images/image13.png" />
button on the Map Toolbar to put the map into Vertex Selection mode.</li>
<li>Select a vertex point on the pipe by clicking on it and then drag it
to a new position with the left mouse button held down.</li>
<li>If required, vertices can be added or deleted from the pipe by right-
clicking the mouse and selecting the appropriate option from the
popup menu that appears.</li>
<li>When finished, click <img alt="image13" src="_images/image12.png" /> to return to Object Selection mode.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="setting-object-properties">
<h2>Setting Object Properties<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-object-properties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As objects are added to a project they are assigned a default set of
properties. To change the value of a specific property for an object
one must select the object into the Property Editor (Figure 2.5).
There are several different ways to do this. If the Editor is already
visible then you can simply click on the object or select it from the
Data page of the Browser. If the Editor is not visible then you can
make it appear by one of the following actions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Double-click the object on the map.</li>
<li>Right-click on the object and select <strong>Properties</strong> from the pop-up
menu that appears.</li>
<li>Select the object from the Data page of the Browser window and then
click the Browser’s Edit button <img alt="image14" src="_images/image14.jpeg" />.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Whenever the Property Editor has the focus you can press the F1 key
to obtain fuller descriptions of the properties listed</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><img alt="image15" src="_images/image15.png" /></div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Figure 2.5</strong> Property Editor</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Let us begin editing by selecting Node 2 into the Property Editor as
shown above. We would now enter the elevation and demand for this
node in the appropriate fields. You can use the <strong>Up</strong> and <strong>Down</strong>
arrows on the keyboard or the mouse to move between fields. We need
only click on another object (node or link) to have its properties
appear next in the Property Editor. (We could also press the <strong>Page
Down</strong> or <strong>Page Up</strong> key to move to the next or previous object of
the same type in the database.) Thus we can simply move from object
to object and fill in elevation and demand for nodes, and length,
diameter, and roughness (C-factor) for links.</p>
<p>For the reservoir you would enter its elevation (700) in the Total
Head field. For the tank, enter 830 for its elevation, 4 for its
initial level, 20 for its maximum level, and 60 for its diameter. For
the pump, we need to assign it a pump curve (head versus flow
relationship). Enter the ID label 1 in the Pump Curve field.</p>
<p>Next we will create Pump Curve 1. From the Data page of the Browser
window, select Curves from the dropdown list box and then click the
Add button <img alt="image16" src="_images/image16.jpeg" />. A new Curve 1 will be added to the database and
the Curve Editor dialog form will appear (see Figure 2.6). Enter the
pump’s design flow (600) and head (150) into this form. EPANET
automatically creates a complete pump curve from this single point.
The curve’s equation is shown along with its shape. Click <strong>OK</strong> to
close the Editor.</p>

for the value of the Pattern Time Step (as shown in Figure 2.8
below). While we have the Time Options available we can also set the
duration for which we want the extended period to run. Let’s use a
3-day period of time (enter 72 hours for the Duration property).</p>

<p>To create the pattern, select the Patterns category in the Browser
and then click the Add button <img alt="image22" src="_images/image16.jpeg" />. A new Pattern 1 will be
created and the Pattern Editor dialog should appear (see Figure 2.9).
Enter the multiplier values 0.5, 1.3, 1.0, 1.2 for the time periods 1
to 4 that will give our pattern a duration of 24 hours. The
multipliers are used to modify the demand from its base level in each
time period. Since we are making a run of 72 hours, the pattern will
wrap around to the start after each 24-hour interval of time.</p>

<p>We now need to assign Pattern 1 to the Demand Pattern property of all
of the junctions in our network. We can utilize one of EPANET’s
Hydraulic Options to avoid having to edit each junction individually.
If you bring up the Hydraulic Options in the Property Editor you will
see that there is an item called Default Pattern. Setting its value
equal to 1 will make the Demand Pattern at each junction equal
Pattern 1, as long as no other pattern is assigned to the junction.</p>
<p>Next run the analysis (select <strong>Project &gt;&gt; Run Analysis</strong> or click
the <img alt="image24" src="_images/image18.png" /> button on the Standard Toolbar). For extended period
analysis you have several more ways in which to view results:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The scrollbar in the Browser’s Time controls is used to display the
network map at different points in time. Try doing this with Pressure
selected as the node parameter and Flow as the link parameter.</li>
<li>The VCR-style buttons in the Browser can
animate the map through time. Click the Forward button <img alt="image25" src="_images/image23.png" />  to start the
animation and the Stop button <img alt="image26" src="_images/image24.png" />  to stop it.</li>
<li>Add flow direction arrows to the map (select <strong>View &gt;&gt; Options</strong>,
select the Flow Arrows page from the Map Options dialog, and check a
style of arrow that you wish to use). Then begin the animation again
and note the change in flow direction through the pipe connected to
the tank as the tank fills and empties over time.</li>
<li>Create a time series plot for any node or link. For example, to see
how the water elevation in the tank changes with time:<ol class="arabic">
<li>Click on the tank.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Report &gt;&gt; Graph</strong> (or click the Graph button <img alt="image27" src="_images/image25.png" />
on the Standard Toolbar) which will display a Graph Selection
dialog box.</li>
<li>Select the Time Series button on the dialog.</li>
<li>Select Head as the parameter to plot.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to accept your choice of graph.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Note the periodic behavior of the water elevation in the tank over
time (Figure 2.10).</p>

<h2>Running a Water Quality Analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#running-a-water-quality-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Next we show how to extend the analysis of our example network to
include water quality. The simplest case would be tracking the growth
in water age throughout the network over time. To make this analysis
we only have to select Age for the Parameter property in the Quality
Options (select Options-Quality from the Data page of the Browser,
then click the Browser’s Edit button to make the Property Editor
appear). Run the analysis and select Age as the parameter to view on
the map. Create a time series plot for Age in the tank. Note that
unlike water level, 72 hours is not enough time for the tank to reach
periodic behavior for water age. (The default initial condition is to
start all nodes with an age of 0.) Try repeating the simulation using
a 240-hour duration or assigning an initial age of 60 hours to the
tank (enter 60 as the value of Initial Quality in the Property Editor
for the tank).</p>
<p>Finally we show how to simulate the transport and decay of chlorine
through the network. Make the following changes to the database:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select Options-Quality to edit from the Data Browser. In the
Property Editor’s Parameter field type in the word Chlorine.</li>
<li>Switch to Options-Reactions in the Browser. For Global Bulk
Coefficient enter a value of -1.0. This reflects the rate at which
chlorine will decay due to reactions in the bulk flow over time.
This rate will apply to all pipes in the network. You could edit
this value for individual pipes if you needed to.</li>
<li>Click on the reservoir node and set its Initial Quality to 1.0. This
will be the concentration of chlorine that continuously enters the
network. (Reset the initial quality in the Tank to 0 if you had
changed it.)</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now run the example. Use the Time controls on the Map Browser to see
how chlorine levels change by location and time throughout the
simulation. Note how for this simple network, only junctions 5, 6,
and 7 see depressed chlorine levels because of being fed by low
chlorine water from the tank. Create a reaction report for this run
by selecting <strong>Report &gt;&gt; Reaction</strong> from the main menu. The report
should look like Figure 2.11. It shows on average how much chlorine
loss occurs in the pipes as opposed to the tank. The term “bulk”
refers to reactions occurring in the bulk fluid while “wall” refers
to reactions with material on the pipe wall. The latter reaction is
zero because we did not specify any wall reaction coefficient in this
example.</p>

<p>We have only touched the surface of the various capabilities offered
by EPANET. Some additional features of the program that you should
experiment with are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Editing a property for a group of objects that lie within a user-
defined area.</li>
<li>Using Control statements to base pump operation on time of day or
tank water levels.</li>
<li>Exploring different Map Options, such as making node size be related
to value.</li>
<li>Attaching a backdrop map (such as a street map) to the network map.</li>
<li>Creating different types of graphs, such as profile plots and contour
plots.</li>
<li>Adding calibration data to a project and viewing a calibration
report.</li>
<li>Copying the map, a graph, or a report to the clipboard or to a file.</li>
<li>Saving and retrieving a design scenario (i.e., current nodal demands,
pipe roughness values, etc.).</li>
</ul>
