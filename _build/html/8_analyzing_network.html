simulation accuracy. Using too small a value will affect
computational efficiency. Some experimentation with this setting

<p>EPANET will issue specific Error and Warning messages when problems
are encountered in running a hydraulic/water quality analysis (see
Appendix B for a complete listing). The most common problems are
discussed below.</p>
<div class="section" id="pumps-cannot-deliver-flow-or-head">
<h3>Pumps Cannot Deliver Flow or Head<a class="headerlink" href="#pumps-cannot-deliver-flow-or-head" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div>EPANET will issue a warning message when a pump is asked to operate
outside the range of its pump curve. If the pump is required to
deliver more head than its shutoff head, EPANET will close the pump
down. This might lead to portions of the network becoming
disconnected from any source of water.</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="network-is-disconnected">
<h3>Network is Disconnected<a class="headerlink" href="#network-is-disconnected" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div>EPANET classifies a network as being disconnected if there is no way
to provide water to all nodes that have demands. This can occur if
there is no path of open links between a junction with demand and
either a reservoir, a tank, or a junction with a negative demand. If
the problem is caused by a closed link EPANET will still compute a
hydraulic solution (probably with extremely large negative pressures)
and attempt to identify the problem link in its Status Report. If no
connecting link(s) exist EPANET will be unable to solve the hydraulic
equations for flows and pressures and will return an Error 110
message when an analysis is made. Under an extended period simulation
it is possible for nodes to become disconnected as links change
status over time.</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="negative-pressures-exist">
<h3>Negative Pressures Exist<a class="headerlink" href="#negative-pressures-exist" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div>EPANET will issue a warning message when it encounters negative
pressures at junctions that have positive demands. This usually
indicates that there is some problem with the way the network has
been designed or operated. Negative pressures can occur when portions
of the network can only receive water through links that have been
closed off. In such cases an additional warning message about the
network being disconnected is also issued.</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="system-unbalanced">
<h3>System Unbalanced<a class="headerlink" href="#system-unbalanced" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div><p>A System Unbalanced condition can occur when EPANET cannot converge
to a hydraulic solution in some time period within its allowed
maximum number of trials. This situation can occur when valves,
pumps, or pipelines keep switching their status from one trial to the
next as the search for a hydraulic solution proceeds. For example,
the pressure limits that control the status of a pump may be set too
close together. Or a pump’s head curve might be too flat causing it
to keep shutting on and off.</p>
<p>To eliminate the unbalanced condition one can try to increase the
allowed maximum number of trials or loosen the convergence accuracy
requirement. Both of these parameters are set with the project’s
Hydraulic Options. If the unbalanced condition persists, then another
hydraulic option, labeled “If Unbalanced”, offers two ways to handle
it. One is to terminate the entire analysis once the condition is
encountered. The other is to continue seeking a hydraulic solution
for another 10 trials with the status of all links frozen to their
current values. If convergence is achieved then a warning message is
issued about the system possibly being unstable. If convergence is
not achieved then a “System Unbalanced” warning message is issued. In
either case, the analysis will proceed to the next time period.</p>
<p>If an analysis in a given time period ends with the system unbalanced
then the user should recognize that the hydraulic results produced
for this time period are inaccurate. Depending on circumstances, such
as errors in flows into or out of storage tanks, this might affect
the accuracy of results in all future periods as well.</p>

<div class="section" id="hydraulic-equations-unsolvable">
<h3>Hydraulic Equations Unsolvable<a class="headerlink" href="#hydraulic-equations-unsolvable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<div>Error 110 is issued if at some point in an analysis the set of
equations that model flow and energy balance in the network cannot be
solved. This can occur when some portion of a system demands water
but has no links physically connecting it to any source of water. In
such a case EPANET will also issue warning messages about nodes being
disconnected. The equations might also be unsolvable if unrealistic
numbers were used for certain network properties.</div></blockquote>
